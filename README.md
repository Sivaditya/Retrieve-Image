Overview : <br>
       <ol> To retrieve downloaded images by monitoring and capturing network traffic with the use of Wireshark and Hex Editor(HxD) </ol><br>
       <i>Features : </i><br>
       <li> JPEG file reconstruction from pcap file
       <li> PNG file reconstruction from pcap file

#Tools used : Wireshark, HxD Hex Editor
In this project, by using Digital Forensics, JPG and PNG images are reconstructed.

Flow :
Step 1: Capturing the network traffic using network analyzers like Wireshark. 
        At this point, we get packet capture(pcap) file. Here the file has extension .pcapng
Step 2: After successful packet capturing, load the pcap file in Wireshark.
Step 3: Now, Wireshark loads the captured data.
        Set the filter to HTTP traffic to know more about the data that has been browsed.
Step 4: As data is requested, the server fetches the data through get method(200=OK).
Step 5: Hey
